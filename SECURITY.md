# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep this project secure!

If you find any security issues, **please don’t share them publicly**.  
Instead, just send me an email at: 
**felix@lunary.ca**

I’ll take a look and fix it as quickly as possible. Here’s what I’ll do:

1. **Acknowledge**: I’ll confirm I got your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigate**: I’ll check out the issue, figure out how serious it is, and start working on a fix.
3. **Resolve**: I’ll release a fix as soon as I can and let you know when it’s done.

## Supported Versions

I mostly focus on the latest version of the project. Please use the most up-to-date version to stay secure.

## Security Updates

Critical security problems will be fixed as soon as I spot them. For smaller issues, I’ll add fixes in the next update.

## Reporting Tips

- Please include as much detail as you can, like how to reproduce the issue if possible.
- Don’t share sensitive info (like passwords) in your report.
- If you can, let me know about your setup (OS, libraries, etc.).

## Best Practices

- Always update your dependencies.
- Follow secure coding practices and avoid hardcoding sensitive info.
- Use encryption and strong authentication for sensitive data when needed.

## Thank You

Thanks again for helping keep this project safe!
